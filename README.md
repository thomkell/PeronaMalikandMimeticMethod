# Perona Malik with Mimetic Method

The Perona-Malik diffusion is a non-linear anisotropic process. The equation is used to blur or denoise images. The advantage compared to a linear diffusion is that the equation does not blur the image around areas that have a high likelihood of being edges. This project report solves the Perona-Malik diffusion equation with the mimetic method within an iterative approach. The mimetic method works for image processing. Furthermore, the output of the algorithm illustrates that the edges are significantly sharper and the other areas are more blurred.
