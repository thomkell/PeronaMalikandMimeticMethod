## Perona Malik with Mimetic Method

The Perona-Malik diffusion is a non-linear anisotropic process. The equation is used to smooth or blur images. The advantage compared to a linear diffusion is that the equation does not smooth or blur the image around areas that have a high likelihood of being edges. This paper solves the Perona-Malik diffusion equation with mimetic differences. The mimetic method can be utilized for image processing driven by PDEs. Furthermore, the output of the algorithm illustrates that the edges are significantly sharper, and the other areas are more blurred or smoothed.
